Learn concept of react from this repo.

Componentization: React components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable pieces of code that can be combined to create complex UIs. Components can be nested within each other, and they can communicate with each other using props.

State management: React state is used to store data that changes over time. There are two main ways to manage state in React: class-based state and hooks. Class-based state uses the this.state property to store state, while hooks use the useState hook.

Hooks: Hooks are a new feature in React that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are a more concise way to write React code, and they can make your code more reusable.

API calls: React applications can make API calls to fetch data from a server. There are a few different ways to make API calls in React, but the most common way is to use the fetch API. The fetch API allows you to make HTTP requests to a server, and it returns a promise that resolves with the response data.
